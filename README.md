Leadership Self-Assessment Form is a modern TypeScript-based application designed to collect and analyze leadership self-assessment data. Built with type safety and modular components, this project is ideal for scalable and maintainable frontend development, commonly paired with React or similar frameworks. The application supports easy customization of the assessment logic and user interface, and it offers a seamless developer experience with hot-reloading during development.

To get started, clone the repository by running `git clone git@github.com:Crispai-collab/leadership_form.git` and navigate into the project directory with `cd leadership_form`. Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or higher) and npm or yarn installed. Install project dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Start the local development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`; the app will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000` with live reload enabled. When ready for deployment, build the optimized production bundle using `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

The project structure includes a `src` directory containing source code such as components and main entry points, and a `public` directory holding static assets including the HTML template. Configuration files like `package.json` for dependencies, `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript settings, and optionally `vite.config.ts` or equivalent for build configuration are located at the root.

You can customize the form by editing or adding components in the `src/components` folder and modifying the main application logic in `App.tsx` or `main.ts`. Styles can be managed through CSS or SCSS files depending on your setup.

Contributions are welcome to improve or extend this project. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your changes. For any questions, issues, or feedback, please open an issue on GitHub or contact the maintainers.
